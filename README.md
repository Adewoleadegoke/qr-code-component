## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

I learned more or how to use CSS properties padding and margin to structure the code elements
```css
.qr {
  padding: 16px;
  margin: auto;
}
```



### Continued development


I want to continue focusing on the div element and the padding and margin CSS properties to help structure and arrange certain elements like text, images and others.
